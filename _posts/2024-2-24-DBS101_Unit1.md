Firstly i have some knowledge about the database and all because we learned one module in the first semester called DSF101 and if i recall what data is then it is a collection of facts or information.
Database is a organized collection of data. And what i learned is about database management system is that it is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data or in simple words it is a system where it manages all the data's.

The main key takeaway form the first lesson was the advantages of having a database system applications which are;
1.Data consistency
2.Grows and adapts easily as it needs change
3.Avoids duplicate data to save space and reduce confusion
4.Better security
5.Simplifies complex data

Secondly from lesson 2 the main key takeaways are;
1.Difference between database and database management system(DBMS)
-Database is a collection of data, whereas a DBMS is a system or a software that allows to create and manage databases. DBMS makes sure that data is always accessible, stored efficiently and can be quickly found even if the system has errors.

2.Types of data models
-There are four types of data models which are Entity-Relationship Model, Semi-structured data model, Object based data model and lastly Relational Model.
-So for this module as mentioned the main focus would be on Relational model and Entity-Relationship model where Relational model organizes data in tables with rows and columns using SQL and Entity-Relationship model gives a visual representation of data and its relationships.
-Entity-Relationship Model

-Relational model

-And the main point is that understanding the data models helps in designing efficient databases.

3.Data abstraction
-There are some levels of data abstraction which are physical level where it describes how data are stored, Logical level where it describes what data are stored in the database and how it is related, and View level where it describes how users see and interact with it.

-The importance of these data abstraction is that it makes things simplier by hiding complicated data, which makes it easier to use the database.

4.Database languages
-The type of database languages we learned were Data-definition language(DDL) and Data Manipulation language(DML) where DDL is used to set up the structure of a database like creating a table whereas DML is used to get and change data in a database like finding, adding, updating or removing data.
-SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.It allows users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently.
-The important thing is that SQL is important for working with Relational database effectively.

5.Database Engine
-A software in a DBMS that manages disk storage and performs CRUD(Creation,Read,Update and Deletion) operations.
-Components of a database engine:
 1.Storage Manager: Manages how data is stored and retrieved.
 2.Query Processor: Interprets and executes database queries. Includes DDL interpreter, DML compiler and Query evaluation engine.
 3.Transaction Management: Makes sure the data is accurate and can be used by multiple people at the same time.

6.Database system architecture of applications that use database as backend.

To conclude all this and about my personal growth and reflections are that this lesson highlights the importance of structured data management which is essential for software engineering students like us. Learning about different database models and SQL provides a strong foundation for our working with applications that use data. And lastly this lesson is valuable if i am planning to create a tech-based business solutions for our country.
