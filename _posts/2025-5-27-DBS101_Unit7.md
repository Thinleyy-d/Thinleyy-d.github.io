### Introduction

As I went through this unit, I gained a deeper understanding of how databases ensure data integrity, handle multiple transactions efficiently, and
recover from failures. The following are my key takeaways from the unit.

### Database Transactions & ACID Properties

#### What is a Transaction?

A transaction is a sequence of operations (like reading or updating data) that form a single logical unit of work. Transactions ensure that 
databases remain consistent even when multiple operations are happening at the same time.

#### ACID Properties

Transactions follow four key properties:

1. Atomicity – Either all operations in a transaction succeed, or none do. If something fails, the database rolls back as if nothing happened.

2. Consistency – Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another.

3. Isolation – Transactions run independently, so one doesn’t interfere with another.

4. Durability – Once a transaction commits, its changes stay permanent, even after a crash.

#### Example in PostgreSQL

BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 50 WHERE account_name = 'A';

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE account_name = 'B';

COMMIT;

- If any step fails, the entire transaction is rolled back (Atomicity).

- The total balance remains the same (Consistency).

- Other transactions won’t see partial changes (Isolation).

- Once committed, changes persist (Durability).



### Concurrency Control & Locks

#### Why Do We Need Concurrency Control?

When multiple transactions run at the same time, they might interfere, leading to incorrect results. Concurrency control ensures transactions run 
smoothly without conflicts.

#### Locks – The Gatekeepers

1. Shared Lock (S) – Multiple transactions can read data, but none can modify it.
2. Exclusive Lock (X) – Only one transaction can read or modify data.

#### Example:

- If Transaction 1 holds an X lock on a row, Transaction 2 must wait before reading or writing it.
- If Transaction 1 holds an S lock, others can also read but not write.

#### Two-Phase Locking (2PL)

A protocol to ensure serializability (transactions appear to run one after another):

1. Growing Phase – A transaction can acquire locks but cannot release any.
2. Shrinking Phase – A transaction can release locks but cannot acquire new ones.

#### Deadlocks – When Transactions Get Stuck

- Detection: The DBMS checks for cycles in a "waits-for" graph.
- Prevention: Uses rules like "Wait-Die" (older transactions wait, younger ones abort) or "Wound-Wait" (older transactions force younger ones to 
abort).

#### Optimistic vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control

- Pessimistic (Locking) – Assumes conflicts will happen and prevents them upfront (e.g., 2PL).
- Optimistic – Assumes conflicts are rare; checks for issues only at commit time.

### Recovery Systems

#### Why Recovery Matters?

Databases can fail due to crashes, power outages, or human errors. Recovery ensures data isn’t lost and transactions remain atomic.

#### Log-Based Recovery

Every change is recorded in a log before applying it to the database.

- Undo: If a transaction fails, the log helps revert changes.
- Redo: After a crash, committed transactions are reapplied.

#### Checkpoints – Speeding Up Recovery

Instead of scanning the entire log, the DBMS periodically saves a checkpoint (a snapshot of active transactions). Recovery starts from the last 
checkpoint, reducing time.

#### ARIES Recovery Algorithm

A sophisticated method used in modern databases:

1. Analysis Pass – Identifies failed transactions.
2. Redo Pass – Reapplies committed changes.
3. Undo Pass – Rolls back incomplete transactions.

#### Remote Backup for High Availability

- A backup system keeps a copy of the database.
- If the main system crashes, the backup takes over using logged transactions.

### Conclusion

Understanding transactions, concurrency control, and recovery is crucial for building reliable databases.The main keypoints are:
- Transactions ensure data integrity with ACID properties. 
- Locks and 2PL manage concurrent access safely.
- Recovery systems (like logging and ARIES) protect against failures.
These concepts help in designing systems that are both efficient and resilient.

#### Final Thought: 
Databases are like well-organized libraries where transactions are the rules, locks are the librarians, and recovery is the backup plan when 
something goes wrong.
