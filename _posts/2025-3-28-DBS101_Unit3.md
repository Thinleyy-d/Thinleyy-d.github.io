### My Journey Through Database Systems: What I've Learned So Far

## The Basics: What's SQL and Why Should I Care?

So I've been taking this Database Systems class, and honestly, at first I thought it would be boring. But I'm actually finding it pretty interesting! We've been learning about SQL, which is basically the language we use to talk to databases.

Thinking of SQL like the language we use to ask our friend to find something in their messy room. Instead of saying "Where's my blue shirt?", we're asking a database "Where are all the customers who spent more than $50 last month?" It's all about asking the right questions to get the information you need.

## ACID Properties: The Foundation of Reliable Databases

One of the first things we learned about was something called "ACID properties." I remember thinking it sounded like something from a chemistry class! But it's actually just an acronym for four important things that make databases reliable:

- **Atomicity**: Either the whole transaction happens, or none of it does. Like when you're transferring money between bank accounts - you don't want the money to leave one account but not arrive in the other!

- **Consistency**: The database stays in a valid state. It's like making sure the total money in all accounts stays the same after transfers.

- **Isolation**: Transactions don't mess with each other. It's like having multiple cashiers at a store who can all help different customers without getting confused.

- **Durability**: Once something is saved, it stays saved, even if the power goes out.


## SQL Commands: The Building Blocks

We spent a lot of time practicing different SQL commands. Here are the main ones I've learned:

- **CREATE**: This is how you make new tables. It's like setting up a new spreadsheet.

- **INSERT**: This adds new data to our tables. Like writing new entries in your spreadsheet.

- **SELECT**: This is how you get data out. It's probably the command I use most often.

- **UPDATE**: This changes existing data. Like fixing a typo in your spreadsheet.

- **DELETE**: This removes data. 

- **DROP**: This deletes entire tables.


I found it helpful to practice these with our airline ticketing system example. We created tables for users, flights, tickets, and payments, then practiced adding and retrieving data.


### SQL Queries and Operations

- Basic queries use SELECT-FROM-WHERE structure

- WHERE clauses filter data with conditions and operators (AND, OR)

- Data can be ordered using ORDER BY

- Tables can be modified using ALTER TABLE

- Records can be filtered using LIKE for pattern matching


### Advanced SQL Concepts

- NULL values require special handling in operations and comparisons

- Aggregate functions (AVG, MIN, MAX, COUNT) perform calculations on data sets

- GROUP BY organizes data into groups for aggregate functions

- HAVING filters groups after aggregation

- Nested subqueries allow complex queries within other queries

- Window functions perform calculations across related rows


### Working with NULL Values

NULL is basically the database's way of saying "I don't know." It's not zero or empty - it's unknown.


### Aggregate Functions

These are super useful for analyzing data. Instead of looking at individual records, we can get summaries:

- COUNT tells us how many records we have
- AVG gives us the average of a column
- MAX and MIN find the highest and lowest values


I used these to find the average ticket price and the most expensive flight in our airline database.\


### Nested Queries

This is where things get interesting! we can put queries inside other queries, like asking "Show me all flights booked by users who live in New York."


## Real-World Applications

What I'm enjoying most is seeing how this applies to real life. Every app we use - from Instagram to food delivery services - has a database behind it. When we search for a restaurant on a delivery app, that's a SELECT query happening. When we place an order, that's an INSERT.

Like our miss showed us how an airline reservation system works behind the scenes. When we book a flight, the system needs to:

1. Check if seats are available (SELECT)

2. Reserve your seat (UPDATE)

3. Create your booking (INSERT)

4. Process your payment (INSERT)

And all of this needs to happen as one transaction - if our payment fails then our seat shouldn't stay reserved!


## My Personal Growth

Learning database systems fundamentals:

- Builds critical thinking skills by requiring logical structuring of data relationships

- Develops problem-solving abilities through query optimization

- Provides essential skills applicable across many technology fields

- Creates a foundation for more advanced database concepts and technologies

Learning databases has changed how I think about the apps I use every day. I now understand why sometimes websites are slow (probably a poorly optimized query) or why certain features work the way they do.

I've also found that database design requires a mix of technical skills and creative thinking. We need to understand the technical aspects of SQL, but we also need to think about how to structure our data in a way that makes sense for our specific application.


## Conclusion: Why Databases Matter More Than I Thought

When I first enrolled in this database course, I wasn't sure how relevant it would be to my future. But after these few weeks of diving into SQL and database concepts, I've completely changed my mind.

Databases aren't just some technical backend thing that only certain types of developers need to worry about. They're actually the foundation of almost everything we do online. Every time I scroll through social media, order food, check my bank balance, or book a flight, I'm interacting with databases.

What I've learned so far has given me a new appreciation for how our digital world works. Understanding concepts like ACID properties helps me see why certain applications are reliable while others might lose our data. Learning about queries and joins shows me how applications can pull together information from different sources to show me exactly what I need.

I've also realized that database skills are incredibly versatile. Whether I end up working as a developer, data analyst, project manager, or even starting my own business, knowing how to structure, query, and maintain data will be valuable.

The airline reservation system we've been building in class has been a perfect example. It's shown me how different pieces of information need to connect together - users, flights, tickets, payments - and how important it is to design these connections thoughtfully from the beginning.

As we move forward in the course, I'm excited to learn more advanced concepts and see how they apply to real-world scenarios. Database systems might not be the flashiest topic, but they're definitely one of the most practical skills I've picked up so far in my studies.
